Through working with my tutor I was able to compile and finish the Crowdsale code, but was unable to successfully test the code as we continued to receive an error message despite a lot of troubleshooting.

To deploy this contract, start by selecting the PupperCoinSaleDeployer. By deploying this first you will obtain the token_address and the token sale address. From there you will want to deploy the PupperCoin contract and then finally the PupperCoinSale contract. The PupperCoinSale address should allow you to purchase Puppercoin tokens.
